Create a new branch from the dev branch.

Do not create branches directly from main.

Make your changes in your new branch.

When your work is ready, open a Pull Request (PR) targeting the dev branch.

If there are no conflicts and the changes are approved, the PR will be merged into dev.

Once the dev branch is tested and confirmed stable, it will be merged into the main branch.

⚠ Important Rules

Do not push directly to main.

Do not push directly to dev.

All changes must go through a Pull Request.

Ensure your branch is up to date with dev before opening a PR.
